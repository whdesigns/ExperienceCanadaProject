# Introduction
##### As part of my university assessment for Web Site Design SWD500 I was tasked with creating a responsive website on a theme my choice. The chosen theme was life in Canada. The intended outcome for this project was to generate further attention to the country as a holiday destination or a place people might wish to immigrate to. This website highlights such topics as Canadian culture, sports, wildlife, and landmarks. The site has been written in HTML5, SASS/CSS3, and JavaScript and is responsive on both mobiles and desktops devices.

 <br /> 

# CodingStyleGuide Overview 
##### The [attached](https://github.com/whdesigns/ExperienceCanadaProject/blob/master/codingStyleGuide.md) markdown file discusses suggested HTML, CSS, and JavaScript elements used throughout this project, as well as the right and wrong approaches for best coding practice. It is worth noting that regular CSS was not used throughout this project, because I wanted to experiement with SASS.  
##### Note: This file was written during the planning stage and some JS elements or features may have changed or been removed since then. 

 <br /> 

# Part One - Configuration

#### Step One: 
###### Open Command line on either Windows or Mac and type in the following to clone the repo onto your desktop:

```
cd ~/Desktop/

git clone https://github.com/whdesigns/ExperienceCanadaProject
```

 <br /> 
 
#### Step Two:
###### Open the cloned repo inside Visual Studio Code on either Windows or Mac.

###### Note: Ensure Node JS is installed. If not [click here](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download it. Once installed npm will be available to use on the terminal. Type....
 
 ```
node -v
 ```
###### in the terminal to ensure the latest version has been installed. 

  <br /> 

#### Step Three:
###### Right click on the "public" folder and select "Open in Terminal". 
###### Type the following into the terminal to install gulp

 ```
sudo npm install gulp-cli -g
 ```
###### After typing in the above code npm will ask for a "password", which is used for your computer.
 
###### Type...

 ```
gulp -v
 ```
###### to check if the latest version of gulp has been installed.

  <br />

#### Step Four: 
###### Install gulp-sass and browser-sync by typing the following into the terminial 

 ```
npm install --save-dev gulp gulp-sass browser-sync
 ```
###### This will automatically update the dependencies in the package.JSON file.

# Part Four - Reflective Evaluation

#### The goal of this project was to develop a website which was mobile and desktop responsive on a grid. The tools used to achieve this objective include Gulp, which was used to install both SASS and browser-sync. Both of which were necessary to update files in real time. Browser-sync (once installed) automatically updated the browser every time the code was changed and saved, while SASS did the same with a CSS file that was automatically generated when installing SASS via Gulp using npm (node package manager). Speaking of npm, this was used to download all the above tools using the terminal in VS Code and store these various dependencies in a package.json file that was automatically generated upon initialising npm. 

#### Throughout the development phase the website started to evolve to include more features than initially intended during the planning phase of this project. For example, browser-sync and SASS were never intended to be used for this project, however, after watching some tutorials and realising that these tools could add useful and contemporary functionality to the project the decision was made to include them to simplify the development process. Another aspect that differed from the planning phase was the feedback circles on the home page. These circles were going to be placed below the first set of rectangle images with quotes and names below, however, the decision was eventually made to modify the design to include star ratings for what users thought of Canada, which made sense since the website is essentially one giant endorsement of Canada. For this reason, the feedback section was turned into articles instead of just images with text. This slight altercation also made it easier to align the row to fit within the grid for both desktop and mobile versions. Another change that was applied was adding hover effects to all rectangular images on the home and culture pages. The purpose of this change was to encourage users to click on the links to access further information about Canada. The mistake that was made during the planning stage was making these static images and whilst the images could appear attractive at first glance, if there is limited call to actions for the user the page will probably have a high bounce rate and the site won’t last long and it was for this reason the hover effects were added. If I could go back and change one aspect about the content of this site it would be to include more call to actions, because at present the site appears limited by the content it promotes e.g. perhaps there is too much imagery but not enough value or incentive for the user to stay on the page. 

#### Firebase was eventually used to host this project and for a while I struggled to understand how to successfully host the site. It was only after watching various YouTube walkthroughs that I understood the configuration process. The main issue was that every time I attempted to upload the files the index.html file kept getting overwritten and replaced with Firebase’s default one. Eventually I realised that I should always press “No” when asked a series of questions during Firebase’s initialisation and that all content must be stored in a folder entitled “public”, this is something I do not believe I could have successfully done without studying various tutorials first. Another issue that kept arising during the development process was implementing the hamburger menu. The idea was to provide a short animation using keyframes in CSS and an external JS file, however for a long time the keyframes animation was not even and tended to veer more towards the left than a balance of both sides. It was only after carefully studying [MDN]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes) and experimenting in an external file that the animation of an X unfolding when the hamburger menu is clicked was successfully implemented.  

#### Based on the feedback received from the user testing forms there are a number of issues that should be addressed if this project is to progress any further. The first and most glaring issue is the load time e.g. when users were asked what they thought of the load time only 60% of them said they thought it was good, 20% said poor and another 20% said excellent. On the surface this does not seem terrible but given how many images are displayed on the site, added with the amount of hover effects, keyframes, and node modules there is certainly room for improvement in this area. The node modules were added to a .gitignore file to ensure they do not slow down they site and the sliders were on included on the mobile versions of the site to reduce the loading time, but based on the feedback and the amount of images included with the project more work is needed. 
#### Other pieces of feedback included *make the text more compelling* and *add the ability to enlarge the text to make the site more accessible to short-sighted people*. The latter point was taken into consideration when using the imagery, because the intention was to convey the subliminal message of visiting Canada through visualisation rather than words, however, if the user wished to read the text in a larger font they always have the opportunity to enlarge the size of the screen both in mobile and desktop versions. As for making the text more compelling, this is something I agree with and was probably the part which had the least amount of effort put in. If I could go back and redo the site, I’d make the paragraphs more compelling by providing more incentives for the user to stay on the page e.g. call to action and limited time offers such as discounts or competitions. 

#### The last two pieces of user feedback received was to *make the grids more consistent* and *provide more user interaction*. I did think that the grids were consistent, however if this is referencing the difference between the home/culture and landmarks/sports pages there is a reason for this, which is because the subjects were more limited further emphasis was placed on making the sports and landmarks images full width instead of separate rows with two columns and hover effects. The point about adding further user interaction I agree with completely. If this site is to be continued in the future, perhaps by adding a user survey for visitors of Canada to rate their experience and then store the results on a database via Firebase or add a map of Canada using an API on the Contact page would be options worth considering.
